## 💼 About Me

**Freelance Company Owner & Full Stack Developer** with a passion for building challenging custom applications. I run my own development company and have built custom applications for numerous clients across various industries. While I don't show off, I'm genuinely capable of delivering complex solutions from concept to deployment.

I've explored various technologies including Go, Ruby on Rails, and others, but I have a strong preference for PHP and MySQL—call me a vintage enthusiast, but I genuinely love these tried-and-true technologies and understand their implications deeply.

**What drives me:**
- Building complex, custom web applications that solve real business problems
- Working with JavaScript in all its forms—any framework, any library
- Delivering reliable solutions that clients can depend on
- Continuous learning and tackling new challenges

**My approach:**
I'm committed, easy to work with, and believe that good code should be both functional and maintainable. I code practically all the time (even if my GitHub doesn't always reflect it) and genuinely enjoy the problem-solving aspect of development.

**Background:**
Former educator turned entrepreneur; 9 years of teaching taught me patience, clear communication, and how to break down complex concepts into understandable pieces.

## 🎯 My Development Philosophy

| **Code Quality** | I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that serves both current needs and future growth. Every project is an opportunity to create something meaningful and lasting. |
| -------- | -------- |
| **Client-Focused** | Real people use the applications I build. My teaching background keeps me grounded in creating user-friendly solutions that actually solve problems. |
| **Continuous Growth** | Technology evolves rapidly, and so do I. Whether it's mastering a new JavaScript framework or diving deeper into backend optimization, I'm always learning and adapting. |
| **AI-Enhanced Development** | I leverage AI tools to accelerate learning and development. What used to take years to master can now be accomplished in days or even minutes, allowing me to focus on solving complex problems and delivering value faster. |
| **Collaborative Spirit** | Great applications are built by great teams. I value clear communication, constructive feedback, and the shared goal of delivering exceptional results. |

## 📋 A Few Personal Notes

- **Former Educator**: 9 years in the classroom taught me patience, communication, and problem-solving
- **Vintage Tech Enthusiast**: I genuinely prefer PHP and MySQL—not because I haven't tried others, but because I love what they can do
- **Always Coding**: Whether it's client work or personal projects, I'm constantly building and experimenting
- **Global Perspective**: I enjoy learning about different cultures and languages (both human and programming!)
- **GitHub Reality Check**: My repositories here represent a fraction of my actual development work—much of my coding happens in private client projects
